## Installation

The easiest way to use React-Date-Select is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-date-select.js` and `dist/react-date-select.css` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included the React, Lodash and classNames packages.

```
npm install react-date-select --save
```


## Usage
